Conventional regression models are not appropriate for analysis of this type of data, because the presence of intra-class correlation among study subjects from the same group violates the assumption that observations are independent of one another. This study demonstrates the advantages of using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to analyze grouped data found in the 1997 Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Specifically, this article presents an HLM example investigating intergenerational dependence on welfare and its relation to child academic achievement. Results show that HLM is a robust and flexible tool that can effectively test various types of research hypotheses, particularly those concerning multilevel influences and macro-to-micro relations. The study shows that early educational intervention is essential in improving child academic achievement for children receiving welfare, particularly for those who used welfare for most of their own childhood and whose caregivers never used welfare."

When measurements are collected over time, the term longitudinal or panel data is preferred. Generalized estimating equations provide a framework for analyzing correlated data. This framework extends the generalized linear models methodology, which assumes independent data. We discuss the estimation of model parameters and associated variances via generalized estimating equation methodology.}

It is important to understand how intervention components are related to patient outcomes and identify barriers to implementation. Designs that permit such assessments are uncommon, however. Thus, an important way of expanding our knowledge about multilevel interventions would be to assess the impact of interventions at different levels on patients as well as the independent and synergistic effects of influences from different levels. It also would be useful to assess the impact of interventions on outcomes at different levels. Multilevel interventions are much more expensive and complicated to implement and evaluate than are single-level interventions. Given how little evidence there is about the value of multilevel interventions, however, it is incumbent upon those arguing for this approach to do multilevel research that explicates the contributions that interventions at different levels make to the desired outcomes. Only then will we know whether multilevel interventions are better than more focused interventions and gain greater insights into the kinds of interventions that can be implemented effectively and efficiently to improve health and health care for individuals with cancer. This chapter reviews designs for assessing multilevel interventions and analytic ways of controlling for potentially confounding variables that can account for the complex structure of multilevel data.}",

The purpose of this article is to clarify the seven major steps involved in a multilevel analysis: (1) clarifying the research question, (2) choosing the appropriate parameter estimator, (3) assessing the need for MLM, (4) building the level-1 model, (5) building the level-2 model, (6) multilevel effect size reporting, and (7) likelihood ratio model testing. The seven steps are illustrated with both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal MLM example from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) dataset. The goal of this article is to assist applied researchers in conducting and interpreting multilevel analyses and to offer recommendations to guide the reporting of MLM analysis results."

 abstract = {Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) is now well established as a method for estimating the parameters of the general Gaussian linear model with a structured covariance matrix, in particular for mixed linear models. Conventionally, estimates of precision and inference for fixed effects are based on their asymptotic distribution, which is known to be inadequate for some small-sample problems. In this paper, we present a scaled Wald statistic, together with an F approximation to its sampling distribution, that is shown to perform well in a range of small sample settings. The statistic uses an adjusted estimator of the covariance matrix that has reduced small sample bias. This approach has the advantage that it reproduces both the statistics and F distributions in those settings where the latter is exact, namely for Hotelling T2 type statistics and for analysis of variance F-ratios. The performance of the modified statistics is assessed through simulation studies of four different REML analyses and the methods are illustrated using three examples.},

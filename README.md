## Standard Error efficacy and it's influence on statistical Power in clustered data - Comparing linear models and hierarchical linear Models
This Master thesis is split in two parts. In the first part multilevel theory is explained on a very basic level. Goal of this part is that psychology students can get an easy understanding of multilevel analysis and it's application. 

The second part of my master thesis contains a simulation study. The main point of this study is to show that if clustering is present within the data, it's advisable to use hierarical linear modelling (HLM) instead of normal multiple linear modelling (MLM). 

Two outcome measures where calculated: 
* **Standard Error (SE) efficacy:** Precision of the SE estimation of a given method. Underestimating tends to result in higher type 1 errors and overestimating tends to result in higher type 2 errors.
* **Power:** The probabillity to reject the null hypothesis when an alternative hypothesis is true.
